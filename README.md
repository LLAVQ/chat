# Chat Application

## Overview

This project implements a chat application that integrates a Telegram bot and a Django web interface, utilizing the GPT-4 model through the `g4f` library. The bot allows users to interact with the AI in a conversational manner while also providing a web interface for chatting. This functionality enhances user interaction by allowing dynamic content generation and personalized responses.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engage in natural language conversations with the GPT-4 model.
- **Web Interface**: A Django-based web interface for chatting.
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context for personalized responses.
- **Clear Context Command**: Users can clear their conversation history with a simple command.
- **Asynchronous Handling**: Built using `aiogram` for efficient message processing in the Telegram bot.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `aiogram` library
- `g4f` library
- Django framework
- A Telegram bot token
