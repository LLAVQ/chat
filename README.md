# ChatGPT Telegram Bot and Web version with JavaScript Execution

## Overview

This project implements a Telegram bot that integrates with the ChatGPT model through the `g4f` library. The bot allows users to interact with the AI in a conversational manner while also providing the ability to execute JavaScript code directly from the responses generated by the AI. This functionality enhances user interaction by allowing dynamic content generation and execution.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engage in natural language conversations with the ChatGPT model.
- **JavaScript Execution**: Execute JavaScript code snippets provided by the AI, enabling dynamic interactions.
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context for personalized responses.
- **Clear Context Command**: Users can clear their conversation history with a simple command.
- **Asynchronous Handling**: Built using `aiogram` for efficient message processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `aiogram` library
- `g4f` library
- A Telegram bot token

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt-telegram-bot.git
   cd chatgpt-telegram-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install aiogram g4f
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Bot Token**:
   Set your Telegram bot token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your_bot_token_here'
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Bot**:
   Execute the bot script:
   ```bash
   python telegram_bot.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Bot**:
   - Start a conversation by sending the `/start` command.
   - Send messages to the bot, and it will respond using the ChatGPT model.
   - Use the `/clear_context` command to clear the conversation history.

## Example Commands

- `/start`: Initiates the conversation with the bot.
- `/clear_context`: Clears the conversation context for the user.

## JavaScript Execution

The bot can respond with JavaScript code snippets that can be executed in a web environment. This allows users to receive dynamic content directly from the AI. For example, the bot might respond with a JavaScript function that fetches data from an API or manipulates the DOM.

### Example Response

```javascript
function fetchData() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data));
}
```
